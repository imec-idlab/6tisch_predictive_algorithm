# Energy-aware adaptive scheduling algorithm for battery-less 6TiSCH routers
This repository will contain the open-source code of a predictive scheduling algorithm for 6TiSCH networks, presented in the paper "Energy-Aware Adaptive Scheduling for Battery-Less 6TiSCH Routers in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks". As the paper is currently under review, the open-source code will be made available after publication.

This repository contains the related code for the paper *[Energy-Aware Adaptive Scheduling for Battery-Less 6TiSCH Routers in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3508540)*.
